<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of this document is to lay out the design for a system that normalizes addresses using USPS
    standards. This system will be built for Dr. Jon Beck. The design presented in this document is
    based on group5_requirements.html which was created on February 22, 2016. Delivery of this document will be on Wednesday
    March 23, 2016 at 12:00 pm.
</p>
    <h2>2. Architectural Style</h1>
    <p>
      The main architectural style is n-tier. N-tier was chosen because the system has different levels including GUI, address preprocessing, and address normalization. There is a standard process which the user instantiates.  Some of n-tier’s strengths lie in separation of duties and keeping it simple. Information hiding is weaker within the n-tier architecture model, but it is not necessary for this project. Within n-tier, there is high modularity and decoupling. The well-defined interfaces makes it easier to adapt to change and can quickly create a working release. 
    </p>

    <h2>3. Future Change and Rationale</h2>
    <p>Future change will be possible through the modularity that the n-tier structure provides. If any new normalization rules are needed, more tiers can be written to provide the additional functionality.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Development Language</h2>
    <p>
    4.1 The team has elected to develop the system in Java. Java was chosen for 3 reasons:
      <ul>
        <li>4.1.1 Every member of the team is proficient in Java, so no additional training time will be necessary </li>
        <li>4.1.2 Java has extensive GUI libraries </li>
        <li>4.1.3 Java has excellent regex support, which will be invaluable to the normalization process.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>5. Use Cases </h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>5.1 Single Address in GUI (Requirement 2.1)
        <ul>
          <li>5.1.1 The user inputs a single address into multiple address boxes. </li>
          <li>5.1.2 The user clicks the “Submit” button.</li>
          <li>5.1.3 The system processes and normalizes the address. </li>
          <li>5.1.4 The user is notified when the normalization is complete. </li>
          <li>5.1.5 The user is presented with the normalized address. </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>5.2 Batch of Addresses in GUI (Requirement 2.1)
          <ul>
            <li>5.2.1 The user browses for a file. </li>
            <li>5.2.2 The user uploads the file. </li>
            <li>5.2.3 The user clicks the “Submit” button. </li>
            <li>5.2.4 The system processes and normalizes the addresses. </li>
            <li>5.2.5 The user is notified when the normalization is complete. </li>
            <li>5.2.6 The user clicks the “See Normalized Addresses” button.</li>
            <li>5.2.7 The user is presented with the normalized addresses in a separate file. (Requirement 2.2) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>5.3 Batch of Addresses from Command Line (Requirement 2.1)
          <ul>
          <li> 5.3.1 The user executes the program. </li>
          <li> 5.3.2 The user is prompted for an input filepath. </li>
          <li> 5.3.3 The user is prompted for an output filepath. </li>
          <li> 5.3.4 The user is prompted to submit the data.</li>
          <li> 5.3.5 The system processes and normalizes the addresses.</li>
          <li> 5.3.6 The user is notified when the normalization is complete.</li>
          <li> 5.3.7 The user is presented with the filepath to the normalized address. (Requirement 2.2) </li>
         </li>
       </ul>
    </p>

	</p>

    <h3>
      6.1 USPSAddressStandardizer Class
   </h3>
   <p>
      The input and output class. Its main job is to display information to the user through a GUI or command line.
      This includes input fields and output.(Requirement 3.4)
      It will be dependent on the AddressProcessor.
   </p>
   <h3>
      6.2 AddressProcessor Class
   </h3>
   <p>
      The address formatting class. The job of the address processor class
      is to format all addresses from the input layer to an easy to use form for
      the Normalizer. It will be dependent on the Normalizer class and aggregate the Address class.
   </p>
   <h3>
      6.3 Normalizer Class
   </h3>
   <p>
      This class normalizes addresses. It will be a set of functions to make sure
      the address conforms to USPS standardization and normalization procedures.(Requirement 2.5)
      It will be dependent on the Address class.
   </p>
   <h3>
      6.4 Address Class
   </h3>
   <p>
      A basic address class. It will hold information of the address and is a wrapper class.
