    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this document is to record questions that will be presented to the client
        in order to gain more knowledge about the requirements for the address normalization system.
    </p>


    <h2>Identify Actors</h2>
    <p>1. Who will be using the system?</p>
    <p>2. Will it be used by the public, one individual, or many users?</p>
    <p>3. Will the user have a technical background?</p>
    <p>4. We will have a database working with our system. Are there any other systems we will need to work with?</p>
    <p>5. What are the specifications on the external database?</p>
    <p>6. What entity or organization are we working for?</p>

    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <p>7. What should the system do with caught address errors or addresses that are not normalizable?</p>

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <p>8. How will this system be run?</p>
    <p>9. What should the system do with mixed up address fields?</p>
    <p>10. What should the system do if there are spanish inputs or abbreviations?</p>

    <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
    <p>11. Will there be a user interface or just a back-end system?</p>
    <p>12. What exactly are the inputs and outputs?</p>
    <p>13. Should the output addresses be sorted or categorized? If so, how?</p>
    <p>14. What defines a valid input?</p>
    <p>15. What invalid inputs are the system not responsible for handling?</p>
    <p>16. What are the most critical functions within the application?</p>
    <p>17. Will we be dealing with postal addressing standards, business addressing standards, or both standards?</p>
    <p>18. Will the inputs be supplied in plain text or in a structured file such as XML or CSV?</p>

    <h2>Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
    <p>19. How many addresses will the system need to normalize at a time?</p>
    <p>20. Will these addresses be sensitive? How secure does the system need to be?</p>
    <p>21. What platforms should this application be able to run on?</p>
    <p>22. Should the system be mobile friendly?</p>
    <p>23. Are there any space requirements that the system must meet?</p>
    <p>24. Will the system need to meet a speed requirement (processing requests in a certain amount of time)?</p>
    <p>25. What is the timetable for this project?</p>
    <p>26. What maintenance will need to be done on this system after deployment?</p>
    <p>27. What level of documentation is necessary?</p>
