<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>

<p>
    The purpose of this document is to lay out the requirements for a system that normalizes addresses using USPS
    standards. It will take an input of one address or a batch of addresses and output normalized versions of the
    input addresses. This system will be built for Dr. Jon Beck. The requirements presented in this document are
    based on the interview with the client on February 11, 2016. Delivery of this document will be on Wednesday
    February 17, 2016 at 12:00 pm.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Success Criteria</h3>
<p>
    The system will normalize all possible correctly entered addresses and allow the user to manually normalize all
    addresses that the system cannot handle on its own.
</p>


<h2>2. Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>
    2.1 The system must take as input either a single address or a file containing a batch of addresses (questions
    12, 18).
</p>
<p>
    2.2 The system must deliver output as a separate file during batch normalization(question 12).
</p>
<p>
	2.3 The system must output any non-normalizable addresses it encounters during batch processing to a distinct error catching file (questions 7, 15, 16).
</p>
<p>
    2.4 The output file must preserve the original ordering of the addresses in the input file (question 13).
</p>
<p>
    2.5 The system must normalize all normalizable addresses taken as input (question 16).
</p>
<p>
    2.6 The system must accept any input which conforms to the following format: {address, city, state, zip-5, zip-4}
    (questions 14, 17).
</p>
<p>
    2.7 The system must inform the user about any duplicated addresses it detects both before and after normalization
    (question 7.d).
</p>
<p>
    2.8 The system must correct any spelling errors that are possible to correct (questions 7.a, 9.a).
</p>
<p>
    2.9 The system must present the user with a list of choices in the event that an address is normalizable but the
    system is unable to distinguish between two or more possible addresses (question 13.a).
</p>
<p>
    2.10 The user should be able to choose the format of the output file (question 12).
</p>


<h2>3. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
<p>
    3.1 The system shall be able to take an arbitrary number of addresses up to 50,000 as input at once (question 19).
</p>
<p>
    3.2 The system shall allow only one user to access it at a time (question 24).
</p>
<p>
    3.3 The system shall be open-source (question 24.d).
</p>
<p>
    3.4 The user will be able to interact with the system via GUI and command line (question 11).
</p>


<h2>4. Glossary</h2>`
<p>
    4.1 GUI: In computer science, a graphical user interface or GUI, pronounced /ˈɡuːi/ ("gooey"), is a type of interface
    that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators, as opposed to
    text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.
</p>
<p>
    4.2 Normalize: To bring or return to a normal condition or state. In this instance, the normalization of addresses is
    to make them compliant with USPS standards.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 Open-source: Software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be
    redistributed and modified.
